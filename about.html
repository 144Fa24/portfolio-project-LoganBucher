            <p> My name is Logan Bucher, I grew up in a small town called Bedford Iowa. I have always had a passion for art and making things to express myself.
            I have a long list of projects that I have made for art classes in the past, and projects that I am currently working on, some of these being included below:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>2D design work</li>
            <li>Line drawings and Ink drawings</li>
            <li>Website deisgn</li>
            <li>Personal projects</li>
            <li>Photoshop</li>
            </ul>
            <p> I also have experince in painting and print making. Growing up in a small town has made it hard to express my art and I am looking for oppertunity to do that.</p>
